# PS5 Web File Manager

A file manager for PS5 with a web UI. It is primarily intended for quickly and
safely copying game dump folders from USB storage to internal storage.

## Brief

PS5 web file manager payload. It runs an HTTP UI starting at port `8888`, installs a home screen launcher in the Media category on startup when needed, and provides file operations from the PS5 browser or another browser on the same network. If `8888` is already in use, the payload tries the next port until one is available; the startup notification shows the actual listen port.

## Features

- List files and folders.
- Sort the list by name, type, size, modified time, or permissions. The selected sort mode is saved in browser local storage.
- Change read/write/execute permissions from the permissions column, using checkboxes or a validated four-digit octal mode.
- Copy, move, delete, rename, create files, and create folders.
- Edit UTF-8 text files up to 1 MiB using the built-in plain text editor.
- Multi-select operations.
- Copy/move by choosing sources first, then pasting or moving them into the current folder.
- Conflict prompts for overwriting files and merging folders.
- Upload files or folders from a remote browser. Upload is hidden in the PS5 browser because it is intended for another device on the network.
- Download a single file directly, or download folders/multiple selections as a `.tar` archive. Download is hidden in the PS5 browser.
- Full-screen task overlay with delayed display, progress, speed, ETA, cancel support, and task recovery after reopening the browser while the payload process is still running.
- Copied/moved files and folders are set to `0777` where the filesystem supports Unix permissions. FAT/exFAT-style filesystems may ignore chmod.
- Uploaded files are written through temporary files and are renamed into place after the upload completes.
- Chinese and English UI. The browser language is read from `navigator.languages` / `navigator.language`; Chinese uses `zh`, everything else uses English.
- Responsive layout for narrow mobile browsers, including wrapped toolbars and horizontally scrollable file lists.
- Startup notification showing the app name, version, and listen port.
- Home screen launcher icon and browser favicon use the same embedded `icon0.png` data in the PS5 build to avoid storing the icon twice in the ELF.
- Create/edit text files ending with `.txt`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.md`, `.log`, `.lua`, `.js`, `.css`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.sh`, `.csv`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.shn`.
- Preview image files ending with `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`.
- Install/Preview PKG files ends with `.pkg`.

## Build

It depends on PS5 payload SDK first: [ps5-payload-dev/sdk](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk#quick-start)

```sh
export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk
```

This project links against `libmicrohttpd`. `make` checks for it before building and runs the installer script automatically if it is missing:

```sh
make
```

If the build host has no network access, download the libmicrohttpd source tarball yourself and run the dependency installer once:

```sh
LIBMICROHTTPD_TARBALL=/path/to/libmicrohttpd-1.0.1.tar.gz \
  ./install-libmicrohttpd.sh
```

Then build again:

```sh
make
```

The output is:

```text
web-file-mgr.elf
```

For local browser/UI testing on Linux:

```sh
make linux
./web-file-mgr-linux
```

The Linux build does not include the PS5 home screen installer.

## Usage

Start an ELF loader on the PS5. The common listener port is `9021`.

Send the built payload with netcat or NetCat GUI:

```sh
export PS5_HOST=ps5_ip_address
nc -q0 "$PS5_HOST" 9021 < web-file-mgr.elf
```

After the payload starts, the PS5 notification shows the app name, version, and actual listen port. Open the shown URL in the PS5 browser, for example:

```text
http://${PS5_IP_ADDRESS}:8888/
```

On first startup the payload installs a `PS5 Web File Manager` web shortcut in the Media category when needed. Existing installed launcher files are not overwritten; missing launcher files are written and then the install step is triggered. If the payload had to use a fallback port such as `8889`, use the port shown in the startup notification.

## Notes

- Copy, move, delete, upload, and download run as single background tasks. While one task is running, other file operations are rejected.
- Delete is recursive and permanent. There is no recycle bin.
- Copy/move tasks can be canceled. A partially copied single file is removed, but partially copied folders are left in place to avoid deleting existing files when merging into an existing target folder.
- Upload tasks can be canceled. A partially uploaded temporary file is removed when possible.
- Downloading a folder or multiple selected items produces a tar stream. The tar archive is generated by the payload and is not written to PS5 storage first.
- The UI can recover the active task display if the browser is closed and reopened while the payload process is still running.
- Text editing is limited to common text-file extensions. Non-UTF-8 and oversized files are rejected.
- File names are transmitted as UTF-8 through the web API. The payload also attempts to preserve legacy byte-oriented names returned by mounted filesystems so mixed USB filename encodings can still be displayed and operated on.

## FAQ
- This is a homebrew app and should not intentionally modify system processes or kernel memory. If a kernel panic happens, make sure you are using a recent jailbreak method and ELF loader, or switch back to the stable method you normally use.
- If you are using P2JB and this payload causes a kernel panic, avoid using it with that setup. Stability matters more than convenience when each retry takes a long time.
- The preparing stage may calculate folder size and check available space. It can be slow when a folder contains many files, but it helps prevent starting a copy, move, upload, or download operation that cannot be completed safely.
